S The question whether should everyone in the world own car , TV and fridge gains high debate . Some considers they are necessary technological objects to the lives while others hold the opposite position . From my perspective , I definitely approve the former opinion that these inventions are the basic facilities to fulfill our lives . \n\nAs for the car which provides great convenience for everyone in the society , it can not be discarded no matter for the work or for the travel and routine life . Imagining there is no car in nowadays , everyone need to walk or ride to the office , which will waste a lot of time and decrease the working efficiency . Even in the poorest countries in Africa , many people own private cars or share the public car to meet the basic need of life . When we talk about TV , which represents an irreplaceable object to fulfill the enjoyment and leisure time . In 16 centuries , there was no TV for people , thus the wealth can hold the party but there is no past - time for the poor . Will we return to the 16 centuries , feeling the boredom and the poverty once again ? I consider this is not a good choice , even the monk also need enjoyment through watching TV programme . The fridge , which was invented in the late 17th owing to the first technology revolution , changed the pattern we stored the food , and even prevented some people from famine , what a great invention ! If we do nâ€™t have a bridge to keep food fresh , whether need us to eat the spoiled food?\n\nAlthough there are some inevitable disadvantages for these inventions , I confirm these productions cann't be abandoned . For example , too many cars will give rise to the gas emission which will pollute the air condition and be harmful on the environment ; the teenagers will be addicted into the fascinating TV programme ignoring studies and the fridge will emit the carbon dioxide leading to the air pollution . But the advantages are obviously overwhelm the disadvantages , must we discard these brilliant and convenient inventions and return to primitive society?\n\nIn a nutshell , as the old saying a coin has two sides , why we overcome the shortcoming of these great inventions and update them to more perfect conditions ? There is a must for everyone to own the car , TV and the fridge especially regarding to their convenience and various functions .

S Nowadays , with the development of economic and technology , we have many transportation to choose . However , the huge amount of use of cars and motorcycles leads to more transportaion difficulty in cities . It is important to know why people continue to use cars and motorcycles in city , and how to finish this problem.\n\nIt is a common phenomenon that people use cars and motorcycles in city , though there are many other public and green transportation to ues . Firstly , cars and motorcycles are more convenient to be used . Everyone can use them everytime to go everywhere , if they use public transportaion , they need to go to the station and wait . The second reason is that the quality has increased . Now in cities , many people can get an satisfied salary , so they have enough money to buy cars and motorcycles as their transport tools . If the price of car and motorcycle is very expensive , less pelple can afford the high bills , and less traffic jar will happen.\n\nIt is important to find out how to solve this problem . According to the first reason , I think public transportation should be intelligent in city , more related app should be provided to book a ticked or check the specific data . And more sharing transportation can be put into used such as sharing bike , it is green and suitabled for short travel . Next , policy can be established to reduce the number of car and motorcycles in city , the buying price of them can be increased , more tax of useing them can be taken , of increased the price of petrol . With the achievement of related policy , more people will give up car or motorcycles and prefer other transportation.\n\nIn conclusion , people continue to use cars and motorcycles because they are convenient and they can pay for them . So increasing related costs of them and providing more intelligent public transportation can be useful for this phenomenon .

S In this contemporary world , money is spent on people themselves who retire from work instead of being saved for their kids . In my viewpoint , it is a positive development as it really benefits people a lot.\n\nPersuasive arguments can be made that spending the money on themselves has many merits . First and foremost , the conscious that all the money they earned can be used by themselves can make people be more energetic on working before they retire from it . That means people can have a clear mind that all troubles they suffered form at that time is worthy for their gurious future , which makes all employees be more concentrate on solving problems as they know they can spend the money they earned to make a more satisfying life . For example , they can travel to Xishuangbanna to enjoy the tropical fruits in there , spending their money to get satisfied.\n\nWhat is more , spending money on things like holidays instead of saving for a really long time for spending on educational field can immediately promote the development of the relevant industries . That is to say , more senior citizens investing money on holidays can help to the development of local tourism , even international tourism.\n\nOn the contrary , the conception of saving for children is harmful for the building of independence of kids . As some of them may lose the ambition for life once they know they can use the money their parents earned , which shows no merit for motivating them to learn more skills for job hunting.\n\nIn conclusion , saving money for children has seriously drawback on children 's own independence ability while investing it on old people themselves can really boost their self - satisfaction .

S I slightly agree with the opinion that parents should encourage children to spend less time on studying and more time doing physical activities.\n\nIn my opinion , a healthy and strong body is more important than a good grade . Many parents in China are more likely to let their children spend much time studying instead of playing sports . So many children in China have weak bodies and short sight . A lack of exercise leads to the weakness of many children.\n\nIn China , students are constantly needed to gather and stand for a long time in big events like ceremonies . There are many news about students falling down in some events because of their weaknesses . These many examples show that many students in China have weak bodies and are lack of exercise.\n\nIn addition , I think a healthy and strong body can offer great help to study . A student who is weak may often miss classes or be unable to take exams due to illness . On the contrary , a healthy student can attend classes well and be more energetic.\n\nWhen I was a middle school student , the teachers in my school often reminded us to do some physical activities . The teachers said that a student can not get an excellent grade without a strong and healthy body . The students in our school always get very good grades on sports tests . And the students ' academic performances are also very good.\n\nSo I support the opinion of parents should encourage children to spend less time on studying and more time doing physical activities .

S With the development of the national economy and the continuous improvement of people 's living standards , people are satisfied with their lives . But can material satisfaction always bring happiness?\n\nAdmittedly I believe that the benefits of additional economic wealth to people are multifaceted . Firstly , an increase in national wealth will also rise personal wealth . People can use this money to participate in various entertainment activities , such as travel , shopping and exercise , which can enrich their lives . Secondly , the country will develop more healthcare , education , elderly care , etc . Citizens no linger need to worry about these issues . Compared to living in a country that worries about food and clothing , a wealthy country can make people happier in life . But after material desires are satisfied , people will pursue spiritual happiness , which money can not provide . \n\nOn the other hand , some people choose a slow paced lifestyle in pursuit of happiness . In the past , many elderly people chose to live in rural areas after retirement . Nowadays , more and more young people have also given up high paying jobs to live a leisurely life in the countryside . Because high paying jobs bring them pressure and health problems . In addition , as wealth increase , one may also overlook their relatives and friends , making oneself feel lonely . For example , wenn the country improves the elderly care system , children will hand over their parents to caregivers for care . Although parents receive better care , they are truly happy wenn they see their children coming to visit them . \n\nThe increase in national wealth improves people 's quality of life . In my opinion , if people 's life have been guaranteed , money can not bring happiness . A healthy body , harmonious interpersonal relationship and disposable free time are the sources of happiness .
