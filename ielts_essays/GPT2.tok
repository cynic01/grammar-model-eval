The question of whether everyone in the world should own a car , a TV and a fridge has gained a high debate . Some consider they are necessary technological objects to their lives , while others hold the opposite position . From my perspective , I definitely approve of the former opinion that these inventions are the basic facilities to fulfill our lives . As for the car which provides great convenience for everyone in society , it can not be discarded no matter for the work or for the travel and routine life . Imagining there are no cars nowadays , everyone needs to walk or ride to the office , which will waste a lot of time and decrease the efficiency of working . Even in the poorest countries in Africa , many people own private cars or share the public car to meet the basic needs of life . When we talk about TV , which represents an irreplaceable object to fulfill the enjoyment and leisure time . In the 16th century , there was no TV for people , thus wealth could hold the party but there was no past - time for the poor . Will we return to the 16th century , feeling the boredom and the poverty once again ? I consider this is not a good choice , even though the monk also needs enjoyment through watching TV programmes . The fridge , which was invented in the late 17th owing to the first technology revolution , changed the pattern we stored food , and even prevented some people from famine . What a great invention ! If we do n't have a bridge to keep food fresh , do we need to eat the spoiled food ? Although there are some inevitable disadvantages to these inventions , I confirm these products cann't be abandoned . For example , too many cars will give rise to the gas emissions , which will pollute the air conditioning and be harmful to the environment ; teenagers will be addicted to the fascinating TV programme , ignoring studies and the fridge will emit carbon dioxide leading to air pollution . But the advantages are obviously overwhelming the disadvantages . Must we discard these brilliant and convenient inventions and return to primitive society ? In a nutshell , as the old saying goes , a coin has two sides . Why do we overcome the shortcoming of these great inventions and update them to more perfect conditions ? There is a must for everyone to own a car , TV and the fridge , especially regarding their convenience and various functions .
Nowadays , with the development of economy and technology , we have many modes of transportation to choose from . However , the huge amount of use of cars and motorcycles leads to more transportation difficulty in cities . It is important to know why people continue to use cars and motorcycles in cities , and how to solve this problem . It is a common phenomenon that people use cars and motorcycles in the city , though there are many other public and green transportation options to use . Firstly , cars and motorcycles are more convenient to use . Everyone can use them anytime to go everywhere . If they use public transportation , they need to go to the station and wait . The second reason is that the quality has increased . Now in cities , many people can get a satisfactory salary , so they have enough money to buy cars and motorcycles as their transport tools . If the price of a car and motorcycle is very expensive , fewer people can afford the high bills , and fewer traffic jams will happen . It is important to find out how to solve this problem . For the first reason , I think public transportation should be intelligent , and more related apps should be provided to book a ticket or check the specific data . And more sharing transportation can be put into use , such as sharing a bike . It is green and suitable for short travel . Next , policy can be established to reduce the number of cars and motorcycles in the city , the buying price of them can be increased , more tax on using them can be taken , and the price of petrol can be increased . With the achievement of related policy , more people will give up cars or motorcycles and prefer other modes of transportation . In conclusion , people continue to use cars and motorcycles because they are convenient and they can pay for them . So increasing related costs of them and providing more intelligent public transportation can be useful for this phenomenon .
In this contemporary world , money is spent on people themselves who retire from work instead of being saved for their kids . In my viewpoint , it is a positive development as it really benefits people a lot . Persuasive arguments can be made that spending the money on themselves has many merits . First and foremost , the consciousness that all the money they earned can be used by themselves can make people be more energetic when working before they retire from it . That means people can have a clear mind that all the troubles they suffered at that time are worthy of their great future , which makes all employees concentrate more on solving problems as they know they can spend the money they earned to make a more satisfying life . For example , they can travel to Xishuangbanna to enjoy the tropical fruits there , spending their money to be satisfied . What is more , spending money on things like holidays instead of saving for a really long time for spending on the educational field can immediately promote the development of the relevant industries . That is to say , more senior citizens investing money in holidays can help to the development of local tourism , even international tourism . On the contrary , the conception of saving for children is harmful for the building of independence for kids . As some of them may lose the ambition for life once they know they can use the money their parents earned , which shows no merit for motivating them to learn more skills for job hunting . In conclusion , saving money for children has serious drawbacks on children 's own independence ability , while investing it on old people themselves can really boost their self - satisfaction .
I slightly agree with the opinion that parents should encourage children to spend less time on studying and more time doing physical activities . In my opinion , a healthy and strong body is more important than a good grade . Many parents in China are more likely to let their children spend a lot of time studying instead of playing sports . So many children in China have weak bodies and short sight . A lack of exercise leads to the weakness of many children . In China , students are constantly needed to gather and stand for a long time at big events like ceremonies . There is a lot of news about students falling down at some events because of their weaknesses . These many examples show that many students in China have weak bodies and lack exercise . In addition , I think a healthy and strong body can offer great help to study . A student who is weak may often miss classes or be unable to take exams due to illness . On the contrary , a healthy student can attend classes well and be more energetic . When I was a middle school student , the teachers in my school often reminded us to do some physical activities . The teachers said that a student can not get an excellent grade without a strong and healthy body . The students in our school always get very good grades in sports tests . And the students ' academic performances are also very good . So , I support the opinion that parents should encourage children to spend less time on studying and more time doing physical activities .
With the development of the national economy and the continuous improvement of people 's living standards , people are satisfied with their lives . But can material satisfaction always bring happiness ? Admittedly , I believe that the benefits of additional economic wealth to people are multifaceted . Firstly , an increase in national wealth will also raise personal wealth . People can use this money to participate in various entertainment activities , such as travel , shopping and exercise , which can enrich their lives . Secondly , the country will develop more healthcare , education , elderly care , etc . Citizens no longer need to worry about these issues . Compared to living in a country that worries about food and clothing , a wealthy country can make people happier in life . But after material desires are satisfied , people will pursue spiritual happiness , which money can not provide . On the other hand , some people choose a slow paced lifestyle in pursuit of happiness . In the past , many elderly people chose to live in rural areas after retirement . Nowadays , more and more young people have also given up high paying jobs to live a leisurely life in the countryside . Because high paying jobs bring them pressure and health problems . In addition , as wealth increases , one may also overlook their relatives and friends , making oneself feel lonely . For example , if the country improves the elderly care system , children will hand over their parents to caregivers for care . Although parents receive better care , they are truly happy when they see their children coming to visit them . The increase in national wealth improves people 's quality of life . In my opinion , if people 's lives are guaranteed , money can not bring happiness . A healthy body , harmonious interpersonal relationships and disposable free time are the sources of happiness .
