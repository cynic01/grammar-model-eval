The question of whether everyone in the world should own a car, a TV, and a fridge is the subject of a heated debate. Some consider them necessary technological objects for their lives, while others hold the opposite position. From my perspective, I definitely approve of the former opinion that these inventions are the basic facilities that help fulfill our lives.\n\nAs for the car, which provides great convenience for everyone in society, it cannot be discarded, whether it is for work, travel, or routine life. Imagine if there were no cars nowadays; everyone would need to walk or ride to the office, which would waste a lot of time and decrease working efficiency. Even in the poorest countries in Africa, many people own private cars or share public cars to meet their basic needs. When we talk about TV, which represents an irreplaceable source of enjoyment and leisure time. In the 16th century, there was no TV for people, so the wealthy could hold parties, but the poor had no pastime. Would we return to the 16th century, reexperiencing boredom and poverty once again? I consider this not to be a good choice; even monks also need enjoyment through watching TV programs. The fridge, which was invented in the late 17th century due to the first technological revolution, changed the way we stored food and even prevented some people from famine. What a great invention! If we donâ€™t have a fridge to keep food fresh, do we need to eat spoiled food?\n\nAlthough there are some inevitable disadvantages to these inventions, I believe that these products cannot be abandoned. For example, too many cars will give rise to gas emissions, which can pollute the air and harm the environment; teenagers may become addicted to fascinating TV programs, neglecting their studies; and fridges will emit carbon dioxide, resulting in air pollution. But the advantages clearly outweigh the disadvantages. Must we discard these brilliant and convenient inventions and return to a primitive society?\n\nIn a nutshell, as the old saying goes, a coin has two sides. Why don't we overcome the shortcomings of these great inventions and update them to be in more perfect conditions? It is a must for everyone to own a car, a TV, and a fridge, especially considering their convenience and various functions.
Nowadays, with the development of the economy and technology, we have many transportation options to choose from. However, the excessive use of cars and motorcycles leads to more transportation difficulties in cities. It is important to know why people continue to use cars and motorcycles in the city, and how to address this problem.\n\nIt is a common phenomenon that people use cars and motorcycles in the city, even though there are many other public and green transportation options available. Firstly, cars and motorcycles are more convenient to use. Everyone can use them anytime to go anywhere. If they use public transportation, they need to go to the station and wait. The second reason is that their quality has increased. Now in cities, many people can afford a satisfactory salary, so they have enough money to buy cars and motorcycles as their mode of transportation. If the price of cars and motorcycles is very expensive, fewer people can afford the high bills, and there will be fewer traffic jams.\n\nIt is important to find out how to solve this problem. According to the first reason, I think public transportation should be made more intelligent in the city, and more related apps should be provided to book a ticket or check specific information. Additionally, more shared transportation options such as sharing bikes can be implemented. They are green and suitable for short trips. Furthermore, policies can be established to reduce the number of cars and motorcycles in the city. The purchasing price of these vehicles can be increased, and more taxes on using them can be imposed, or the price of petrol can be increased. With the implementation of these policies, more people will give up cars or motorcycles and prefer other modes of transportation.\n\nIn conclusion, people continue to use cars and motorcycles because they are convenient and they can afford them. So, increasing the related costs of using them and providing smarter public transportation can be effective in addressing this phenomenon.
In this contemporary world, money is being spent on people themselves who retire from work instead of being saved for their kids. In my viewpoint, it is a positive development as it really benefits people a great deal.\n\nPersuasive arguments can be made that spending money on themselves has many merits. First and foremost, the consciousness that all the money they earned can be used by themselves can make people more energetic in their work before they retire from it. That means people can have a clear mind that all the troubles they suffered from at that time were worthy of their own future, which makes all employees more focused on solving problems as they know they can spend the money they earned to create a more satisfying life. For example, they can travel to Xishuangbanna to enjoy the tropical fruits there, spending their money to experience satisfaction.\n\nWhat is more, spending money on things like holidays instead of saving for a long time for spending on the educational field can immediately promote the development of the relevant industries. That is to say, senior citizens investing money on holidays can contribute to the development of local tourism, even international tourism.\n\nOn the contrary, the conception of saving for children is harmful for the building of children's independence. As some of them may lose the ambition for life once they know they can use the money their parents earned, which shows no merit in motivating them to learn more skills for job hunting.\n\nIn conclusion, saving money for children has serious drawbacks on their independence abilities, while investing it in old people themselves can really boost their self-satisfaction.
I slightly agree with the opinion that parents should encourage children to spend less time on studying and more time engaging in physical activities. In my opinion, a healthy and strong body is more important than a good grade. Many parents in China are more likely to let their children spend a much time studying instead of playing sports. As a result, many children in China have weak bodies and develop short sightedness. A lack of exercise leads to the weakness of many children.\n\nIn China, students are often needed to gather and stand for a long time in big events like ceremonies. There are many news reports about students falling down in some events because of their lack of physical fitness. These numerous examples show that many students in China have weak bodies and lack exercise.\n\nIn addition, I think a healthy and strong body can offer great support for studying. A student who is weak may often miss classes or be unable to take exams due to illness. On the contrary, a healthy student can attend classes well and be more energetic.\n\nWhen I was a middle school student, the teachers in my school often reminded us to participate in physical activities. The teachers said that a student cannot get an excellent grade without a strong and healthy body. The students in our school always achieved very good grades on sports tests, and the students' academic performances are also very good.\n\nSo, I support the opinion that parents should encourage children to spend less time on studying and more time engaging in physical activities.
With the development of the national economy and the continuous improvement of people's living standards, people are satisfied with their lives. But can material satisfaction always bring happiness?\n\nAdmittedly, I believe that the benefits of additional economic wealth to people are multifaceted. Firstly, an increase in national wealth will also raise personal wealth. People can use this money to participate in various entertainment activities, such as travel, shopping, and exercise, which can enrich their lives. Secondly, the country will develop more healthcare, education, elderly care, etc. Citizens no longer need to worry about these issues. Compared to living in a country that worries about food and clothing, a wealthy country can make people happier in life. But after material desires are satisfied, people will pursue spiritual happiness, which money cannot provide.\n\nOn the other hand, some people choose a slow-paced lifestyle in pursuit of happiness. In the past, many elderly people chose to live in rural areas after retirement. Nowadays, more and more young people have also given up high-paying jobs to live a leisurely life in the countryside. Because high-paying jobs bring them pressure and health problems. In addition, as wealth increases, one may also overlook their relatives and friends, making oneself feel lonely. For example, when the country improves the elderly care system, children will hand over their parents to caregivers for care. Although parents receive better care, they are truly happy when they see their children coming to visit them.\n\nThe increase in national wealth improves people's quality of life. In my opinion, if people's lives have been guaranteed, money cannot bring happiness. A healthy body, harmonious interpersonal relationship, and disposable free time are the sources of happiness.
